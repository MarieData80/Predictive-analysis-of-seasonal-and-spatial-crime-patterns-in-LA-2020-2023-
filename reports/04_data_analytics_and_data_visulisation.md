# Data Analytics & Data Visualisation / Dashboards Communication 

As previously said the analytical process was completed using Excel, Power Query, and Power BI. Data cleaning was first completed in Excel and Power Query before importing the dataset into Power BI for analysis and visualisation. Power BI was used as the main tool because it provides sharp graphics, dashboards, and slicers, which allowed the dataset to be divided by year and used interactively 3 (Data Visualisation: A Handbook for Data Driven Design. Sage, 2016 Kirk, A. (2016).

Visualisation Fig 04 is a line graph showing total crimes per year. The clear message in this graph is the sharp drop in 2021, explained by the COVID-19 lockdown, followed by an increase in 2022 and beyond. 
This graph supports the initial hypothesis that crime levels would show both seasonal and external influences, with 2021 as an outlier due to exceptional global circumstances.

Spatial analysis was also analysed. A Power BI map chart was used to show where crimes occurred between 2020–2023. An early data cleaning error showed some data visuals off the coast of Africa; this was investigated and showed missing latitude and longitude values defaulting to zero. Cleaning was repeated, and correct coordinates were applied. The final visualisation showed the highest crime areas were Central, 77th Street, Pacific, Southwest, and Hollywood, with Foothill showing the lowest levels. Interactive slicers were included enabling viewers to make comparisons between years and locations making cross reference of the data user friendly.

The visualisation on Fig 06 is a line chart with interactive drill-downs showed that Fridays consistently recorded the most crime. In 2023, Friday had around 10% more incidents than Tuesday, the quietest day

A clustered column chart grouped incidents into time blocks, showing that crime rose after midday, peaked through the evening, and declined after midnight. These results suggest staffing and resources could be targeted more effectively towards late afternoons, evenings, and weekends. The visual also shows that central is the most targeted area for crime.

In Fig 08 monthly seasonality was also consistent, what stands out is that the 2021 data although it is of a smaller volume follows the same pattern as the other years. 
The line chart shows data points rising in May, remaining high through summer, dipping in September, rising again in October, falling in November, and peaking in December. While some variation exists, this seasonality data may relate to tourism, public holidays, and events such as Halloween. Research supports the idea that crime is seasonal, often increasing during warmer months and holiday periods 4 (Seasonal cycles and crime trends. Crime Science Farrell & Pease, 2017).

Fig 10

Fig 10 is a 12-month moving average with a linear trendline. This showed the 2021 dip clearly, a recovery in 2022, and then a slight decrease. The trendline suggested a slight increase from 2020–2024. Using a R² value which was 0.0051, showing effectively no predictive power. While descriptive analytics was effective in identifying weekly and seasonal cycles, prediction of long-term increases or decreases was unreliable.
