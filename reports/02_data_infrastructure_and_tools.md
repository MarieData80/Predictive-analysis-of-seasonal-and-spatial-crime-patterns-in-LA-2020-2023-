# Data Infrastructure & Tools 

The dataset was downloaded from Kaggle an open-source platform. The main strength of this ecosystem is that it is free to access datasets that are uploaded and shared for public use. The strengths of the data ecosystem is accessibility to open data sets such as the Crime Data set from the LAPD. 

Data sets are put through several data governance tests to enable human and machine learning 1(Munappy, A., Bosch, J., Olsson, H.H., Arpteg, A. and Brinne, B. (2019).) 

The open ecosystem data also enables studies of the LA Crime Data set to be mirrored or replicated using UK policing data enabling Data Driven Decisions. 

The initial LA Crime data set had 10 years minimum of data, the decision was made to reduce the data sample down to 4 years 2020-2023 this is the most recent timeframe also 2024â€™s data was incomplete. 

Python would have been the superior choice to clean and analyse the dataset but based on lack of Python skillset Excel, Power Query and Power Bi were the most suitable tools. Allowing cleaning and transformation of large datasets. 
Visuals in Power Bi create clear interactive visuals to compare parts of the dataset namely years. 

The dataset had governance and data quality issues that were addressed at the data engineering stage these included quality issues such as completeness and accuracy of data as well as formatting issues. 

The LA data analysts will have ensured that the data is anonymised whilst they were completing their data legal and ethical quality checks however the data was still checked once being analysed to ensure that it is completely anonymous.
